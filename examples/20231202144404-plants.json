It does not do well in soil that is too dry or too waterlogged. \n\n**Ideal Temperature Range:** Golden Pothos thrives in temperatures between 60°F (15°C) and 80°F (27°C). It does not tolerate frost and can be damaged by cold temperatures.\n\n**Care Instructions:** \n1. **Light:** Golden Pothos prefers medium to low light conditions and is extremely tolerant of a wide range of light conditions, making it perfect for indoor growing. \n\n2. **Water:** Water your plant regularly during the growing season and reduce watering during the winter. Let the top of the soil dry out slightly between watering.\n\n3. **Fertilizer:** Feed your Pothos with a balanced liquid foliage houseplant fertilizer that contains macro-nutrients. Water the plant regularly to keep it healthy.\n\n4. **Pruning:** Regular pruning helps the plant to retain its bushy appearance. \n\nGolden Pothos is a versatile plant with a hardy nature, making it ideal for those who may not have a green thumb or are new to plant care.",

    "info": "The plant name is \"succulents.\"\n\nSucculents are a type of plant that retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. They are very easy to care for and are popular for their diverse shapes and colors. \n\nCare Instructions:\n1. Watering: Water succulents sparingly. They store water in their leaves, roots, and stems. Therefore, overwatering can cause them to rot.\n2. Light: They prefer bright light, but not directly from the sun, especially during peak hours, which can cause their leaves to burn.\n3. Fertilizer: During the growing season, succulents appreciate a bit of fertilizing, but not too much; over-fertilizing can lead to rapid, weak growth.\n\nSoil Preferences: Well-draining soil mix. You can also use potting mix specifically designed for succulents.\n\nIdeal Temperature Range: Throughout the year, the ideal temperature for succulents is between 70°F and 80°F. During the winters, they prefer slightly cooler temperatures, around 50°F and 60°F.\n \nOther Names: Common types of succulents include \"Aloe Vera,\" \"Jade Plants,\" \"Snake Plants,\" and \"Ponytail Palms.\" Each of these types also has its own set of specific names based on their variety.",

    "info": "**Cape Sundew**\n\nThe Cape Sundew (Drosera capensis) is a small rosette-forming carnivorous species of perennial sundew native to the Cape in South Africa.\n\n**Watering**\nCape Sundews prefer to be watered using the tray method, which is about ensuring the plant always sits in a couple inches water.\n\n**Sunlight**\nThey enjoy a lot of sunlight. If grown indoors, they should be close to a south-facing window or grow light.\n\n**Feeding**\nCape Sundews are carnivorous plants that you feed with insects, usually small flies and gnats. Fertilization is typically not necessary as they get most of their nutrition from the insects they catch.\n\n**Pruning**\nPruning isn't usually necessary for the Cape Sundew, although dead leaves can be removed to maintain appearance.\n\n**Soil Preferences**\nThe Cape Sundew prefers a soil mix of one part sand and one part peat. Do not use regular potting soil.\n\n**Ideal Temperature Range**\nThis plant prefers temperatures between 15–40 °C (60–100 °F). Cape Sundews can live outside even in very chilly climates, as long as they are brought inside before a frost.\n\n**Other Common Names**\nCape Sundew is also known under its botanical name Drosera capensis, and locally in South Africa, it is referred to as the \"Octopus Plant\".\n\n**Additional Information**\nBe aware that this plant is carnivorous and consumes insects for nutrition. Its leaves produce strings of sticky \"dew\" to attract, trap, and digest insects, which is where the \"sundew\" part of its name derives from. In the absence of insects, you can feed it bloodworm every so often.",
